## Guild Wars 2 University
![Image](assets/guild-wars-2.png)

Guild Wars 2 University is a Guild Wars 2 community that specifically targets engagement from new and veteran players across all game modes. Guild Wars 2 has been out for several years now, and with it, new and exciting challenges, content, and changes have been improved upon. This can be daunting for a new player just joining the universe, or a veteran player, coming back from a long hiatus. Come join us at <https://discord.gg/gw2-uni>!


# Installation

To add these cogs to your RedBot, first add the repo by running\
`[p]repo add custodian https://github.com/noahdm4321/GWU-Cogs`

Then, install the cogs by running `[p]cog install custodian <name_of_cog>`

And load them with `[p]load <name_of_cog>`


# Support

This repository is not officially approved for use on the Red Bot. You can find actually approved repos on the [Red Index](https://index.discord.red).

As such I am under no obligation to support it in any way. So because I have a *life*, I will not support this repo.
If you have any complaints or issues with the cogs, please take your frustration out on your computer by smashing the keyboard. Thank you.
